1) Store deviations
-> def select_by_deviation has to be changed
-> so far returns only a single list
-> split this function in two part: calculations of deviations, then selection?
-> when changing to "return  selected_curves_idx" then:
 "correlation_curves_fine[curve_idx]
IndexError: arrays used as indices must be of integer (or boolean) type"

2) Correct stdev for curves => done
-> divide stdev by sqrt of nr of selected curves

2) Autocorrelation => done
-> has to be added to main correlator script
-> same photon-id have to be used for correlation as in crosscorrelation (for comparability)
-> possible to somehow save this curve-ids and give them to autocorrelation function?
-> Caution: for ACF no microtime correlation is required, normal correlation is sufficient

3) Calculation and saving of avg countrate per slice per channel
-> to be able to later calculate the brightness of molecules
-> why per channel? dim vs bright molecules ~> oligomers ~> different anisotropy?

4) log file
-> how can i get access to the many values on has to give?
-> is it possible to collect all of them in a single file?
-> Information which I would like to have: 
	n_correlations (= nr of slices)
	d_max
	comparison_start
	comparison_end
	(how many compared to)
	selected_curves ~> length
	time_window_size
	filename
